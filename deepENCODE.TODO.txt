deepENCODE TODO: 2 April 2020 

1) Make RC layers work with reasonable pearson values for CT exchangeable.

2) Add residual connections and dilated convolutions to the architecture.
Systematically study the parameters' effect on performance.

3) Train 10 models for each cell-type and assay-type exchangeability and benchmark their ensemble combinations.

4) Create a scheme to convert the p-values into classification bins and optimize over those

5) Design specific Test datasets for probing each combinatorial hypotheses.

6) Implement ISE using an ensemble of trained networks as an in-silico oracle.
