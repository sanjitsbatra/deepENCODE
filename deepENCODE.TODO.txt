deepENCODE TODO: 31 May 2020 

1) grep for "Classification" to switch to it (Flags not implemented)

2) Predict Gene Expression with batches at TSS only

3) Remove seg_len because training data points are not large in number now.

4) Change architecture to predict MSE on TPM across different cell types.

5) Create evaluation scheme for model (with dropping out during prediction?).
